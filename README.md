I'm Karol, an enthusiast with limited experience in the IT industry (yet).

By education, I am an OHS specialist... Wait, what? What are you doing here?!<br>
Simultaneously, I am currently studying Data Science, which is the field I genuinely want to develop in.

I have always been optimizing tasks/things, I've lately started automating them.<br>
This year I've discovered the joy of building applications, designing UI/UX, and implementing AI, whenever it makes sense.

Currently, I have 2 project pinned, which I am genuinely satisfied with.<br>
Particularly ORZApp, which I use daily in my 'first life' and I'm looking forward to developing.

Feel free to contact me!
